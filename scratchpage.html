    <a href="#why-koto">Why Koto?</a>

    <p>There are some groups that include Koto for their music these days, and they are so popular around the world. Also, I helped some events that tourists from other countries come and try playing Koto with experiencing other Japanese cultures such as snacks, tea, or kimono. And the event done very well, and tourists left the questionnaire with good comments.</p>
    <p>Also, the data below shows us that the tourists in Japan is increasing in the long period. And at the same time, the traditional instrument Koto is declining in Japan because there are not enough children to have an interested in it, but if the tourists can have an interest in it, the population who play the Koto in the future so that it helps us to inherit it.</p>
